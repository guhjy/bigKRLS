Title: Memory and Runtime Optimized Kernel Regularized Least Squares
Version: 1.5.1

Author: Pete Mohanty and Robert B. Shaffer

Description: Functions and visualization tools for Kernel-Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), using Shiny, bigmemory, and
    Rcpp in parallel. KRLS is both flexible and interpretable, but encounters
    steep scalability challenges. We address these by handling larger than memory objects in C++ 
    and with parallel processing for speed. For working papers, sample code, and links to presentations
