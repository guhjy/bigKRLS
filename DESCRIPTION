Title: bigKRLS: Memory and Runtime Optimized Kernel Regularized Least Squares with Shiny 
Version: 1.5.1
Date: 2016-05-15
Author: Pete Mohanty and Robert B. Shaffer
Maintainer: Pete Mohanty<pete.mohanty@gmail.com>
Description: bigKRLS estimates pairwise regression models with KRLS with big matrices using
    RcppArmadillo in parallel. The pairwise models are highly flexible yet interpretable but encounter
    steep scalability challenges. We address these by handling larger than memory objects in C++ 
    and with parallel processing for speed. For working papers, sample code, and links to presentations
